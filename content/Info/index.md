Daniel Perry is a Canadian Swiss photographer, cyclist and engineer currently based in Montreal. He's also lived in Toronto, Geneva, Accra & Addis Ababa.

Photography: I'm currently shooting 90s canon SLRs - late film era camera bodies with modern autofocus and metering systems and compatible with all canon EF lenses. Since I started developing and printing in the darkroom I've mostly shot in black and white on ilford hp5+ and fomupan. I still have my digital fujifilm xt3.
